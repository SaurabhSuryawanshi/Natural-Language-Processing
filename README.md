Overview:

This project focuses on leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to build two interconnected applications: sentiment analysis and a book recommendation system.

Sentiment Analysis:
  
- Sentiment analysis involves identifying and categorizing the emotional tone behind text, such as user reviews, social media posts, or book descriptions.
- The aim is to determine whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. Advanced NLP methods like word embeddings, transformers, or pre-trained models can be employed for this purpose.
- This module helps understand audience preferences, enabling improved personalization and insights.

Book Recommendation System:

- The system uses NLP to recommend books to users based on their preferences, reading history, or interests.
- Techniques such as word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec) and similarity measures (e.g., cosine similarity) are applied to create relationship.

Amazon Review Analysis:

-Rating Prediction Models:- Advanced machine learning models integrated with NLP can predict product ratings based on textual reviews and customer behavior metrics.
These models use features like sentiment scores, engagement metrics, and temporal factors to provide accurate predictions.

-Feature Engineering:- NLP can extract specific product features mentioned in reviews, helping sellers highlight key attributes and improve product descriptions.

Features:-

- Text Cleaning: Remove special characters, numbers, and punctuations.
- Tokenization: Split sentences into words or subwords.
- Stopword Removal: Filter out commonly used words that add minimal meaning.
- Stemming and Lemmatization: Reduce words to their base or root form.
- Normalization: Lowercase conversion, removing diacritics, and handling contractions.
- Encoding: One-Hot Encoding, MinMaxScalar.

-Feature extraction using TF-IDF Vectorization.

-Binary sentiment classification using Naive Bayes and SVM and Logistic Regression.

-Books recommendations based on titles, genre and their description.
