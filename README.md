- Stemming and Lemmatization: Reduce words to their base or root form.
- Normalization: Lowercase conversion, removing diacritics, and handling contractions.
- Encoding: One-Hot Encoding, MinMaxScalar.

-Feature extraction using TF-IDF Vectorization.

-Binary sentiment classification using Naive Bayes and SVM.

-Books recommendations based on titles, genre and their description.
