Overview:
This project focuses on leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to build two interconnected applications: sentiment analysis and a book recommendation system.

Sentiment Analysis:
  
- Sentiment analysis involves identifying and categorizing the emotional tone behind text, such as user reviews, social media posts, or book descriptions.
- The aim is to determine whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. Advanced NLP methods like word embeddings, transformers, or pre-trained models (e.g., BERT) can be employed for this purpose.
- This module helps understand audience preferences, enabling improved personalization and insights.

Book Recommendation System:

- The system uses NLP to recommend books to users based on their preferences, reading history, or interests.
- Techniques such as word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec) and similarity measures (e.g., cosine similarity) are applied to create relationship


Features:-

- Text Cleaning: Remove special characters, numbers, and punctuations.
- Tokenization: Split sentences into words or subwords.
- Stopword Removal: Filter out commonly used words that add minimal meaning.
- Stemming and Lemmatization: Reduce words to their base or root form.
- Normalization: Lowercase conversion, removing diacritics, and handling contractions.
- Encoding: One-Hot Encoding, MinMaxScalar.

-Feature extraction using TF-IDF Vectorization.

-Binary sentiment classification using Naive Bayes and SVM.

-Books recommendations based on titles, genre and their description.
